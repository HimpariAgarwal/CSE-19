      Web development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining
      websites and web applications. It involves a range of tasks, including web
      design (the visual look and user interface), back-end development
      (server-side logic and database management), and front-end development
      (what the user sees and interacts with). Core technologies include
      programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end is the "behind-the-scenes"
      part that powers the website, including the server, application, and
      database.</p>
